# IMDB Review Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The model is designed to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset and assign a percentage score representing the sentiment (the closer to 100%, the more positive the review).

# Dataset
The model is trained on the IMDB dataset, which consists of a large collection of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset is widely used for sentiment analysis tasks in NLP.

# Model Architecture
The NLP model utilizes the power of LSTM cells to capture long-term dependencies in the text data. LSTM is a type of RNN that can retain information over longer sequences, making it well-suited for sentiment analysis tasks. The model is trained using a combination of word embeddings, LSTM layers, and dense layers for classification.
